# NTU EE7401 Probability and Random Processes Cheat Sheet

## Disclaimer

‼️ Before diving into this treasure trove of condensed knowledge, a couple of friendly heads-ups‼️:

- **Examination Policy Check**: The world of academia is ever-evolving, and so are its rules. If you're gearing up for an exam, double-check if 'NTU EE7401 Probability and Random Processes' is still a restricted open-book exam. Policies have a knack for changing when you least expect them to.
- **Mistakes? Could Be!**: As much as I'd like to claim perfection, I'm only human. So, there's a slim chance that this cheat sheet might harbor a few errors. I'm not responsible if they sneak into your answers, but hey, feel free to play the hero by pointing them out. Found a mistake? Open an issue, and let's squash those bugs together!

## Project Description

Welcome to the world of 'Probability and Random Processes', a place where randomness is the only constant! From 2023, professors decided to make EE7401 a restricted open book exam. Great news for folks like me whose brains tend to go on a vacation during exams. 

This project is a lighthearted attempt to distill the vast ocean of this course into a nifty cheat sheet. Think of it as your compact companion in navigating the turbulent waters of probability and random processes. 

BTW, this project is firstly created on Overleaf, you may view it via this **[LINK](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xbstyvrmtzdm#f8d40b)**. The newest version will be on the Overleaf as well.
